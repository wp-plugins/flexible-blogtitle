== Description ==

**Flexible Blogtitle** is a lightweight and user friendly WordPress plugin that allows you to define a custom blog title for certain posts and pages.

It comes with an intuitive settings page that lets you define *rules* under which a certain blog title should be displayed, including:

* Post ID
* Page ID
* Post/page title
* Category
* Taxonomy
* Term

Each object can be assigned with one of the available *operators*:

* is <Value>
* is not <Value>
* contains <Value>

Finally, you can set the new blog title that should be displayed if a rule matches the page the viewer is currently viewing.
